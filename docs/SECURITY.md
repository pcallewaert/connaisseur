# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The last known significant security vulnerability was in version 1.3.0 (Connaisseur not validating initContainers). However, since both Python packages and OS packages in the Connaisseur image may become known to be vulnerable over time, we suggest either frequently rebuilding the Connaisseur image from source yourself or updating to the latest Connaisseur image. We strictly stick to semantic versioning, so unless the major version changes, updating Conaisseur should never brake your installation.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are very grateful for reports on vulnerabilities discovered in the project, specifically as it is intended to increase security for the community. We aim to investigate and fix these as soon as possible. Please submit vulnerabilities to [connaisseur@securesystems.dev](mailto:connaisseur@securesystems.dev).
