### VALIDATORS ###
# validators are a set of configurations (hosts, types, public keys) that can be
# used for validating one or multiple images (or image signatures). They are tied
# to their respective image(s) via the image policy below. There are a few handy
# validators pre-configured.
validators:
# static validator that allows each image
- name: allow
  type: static
  approve: true
# static validator that denies each image
- name: deny
  type: static
  approve: false
# the `default` validator is used if no validator is specified in image policy
- name: default
  type: notaryv1  # cosign is also experimetally supported
  host: notary.docker.io # configure the notary server to be used
  pub_keys:
  # the `default` key is used if no key is specified in image policy
  - name: default
    key: |  # enter your key below
      -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
      <add your public key here>
      -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
  # cert: |  # for communication, using a selfsigned certificate
  #   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  #   ...
  #   -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  # auth:  # basic authentication against the notary server
  #   # either
  #   username: notaryuser
  #   password: notarypass
  #   # or
  #   secret_name: notarysecret  # define a k8s secret with `username` and `password` fields
# pre-configured nv1 validator for public notary from Docker Hub
- name: dockerhub_essentials

### IMAGE POLICY ###
# the image policy ties validators and images together whereby always only the most specific rule (pattern)
# is applied. Specify if and how images should be validated by which validator.

# alerting is implemented in form of simple POST requests with json payload
# you can use and/or adapt the predefined Slack/OpsGenie/Keybase templates and the examples below
# to channel alert notifications to Slack/OpsGenie/Keybase or create a custom template for a customized alert
# payload to use with a simple POST request to the receiver_url to receive alerts.
# Parameters you can use in your templates are "alert_message", "priority", "connaisseur_pod_id", "cluster",
# "timestamp", "request_id" and "images" each one basically meaning what their names indicate
